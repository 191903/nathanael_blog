## Conclusion

I hope that reading this blog has made you more interested in lizards. The realization of this portfolio allowed me to personally learn more than I knew about them (more particularly on the origin of some of them) and allowed me to practice and improve my English. The choice of our subject being free, this work was all the more pleasant to carry out over the months. I would like to thank my professor, Ms. Bouchet, who allowed us to carry out this work within the framework of the "English for sciences" course in collaboration with the "Data science" course of the University of Mons in Belgium.
