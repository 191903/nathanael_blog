The data used in this study come from the image analysis of zooplankton from Tulear (Madagascar).

```{r graphique}

SciViews::R

data <- read("zooplankton", package = "data.io")

zooplankton_sub <- filter(zooplankton, class %in% c("Decapod", "Calanoid", "Cyclopoid", "Appendicularian"))

chart(zooplankton_sub, ~ perimeter %fill=% class | class) +
  geom_histogram(data = select(zooplankton_sub, -class), fill = "grey", bins = 25) + 
  geom_histogram(show.legend = TRUE, bins = 25) +
  ylab("Effectifs") +
  scale_fill_viridis_d()

```

We can see that the calanoids are the sea urchins studied with the largest perimeter on average and that the decapods are those with the smallest average perimeter.
